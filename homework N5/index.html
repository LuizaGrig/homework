    <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <section>
      <div class="first-section">
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
          dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
          should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>
        <p id="second-paragraph">
          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
          across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously,
          development of various parts of CSS specification was done
          synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations.
          You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never
          become an official version.
        </p>
        <p>
          From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and
          the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that
          it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
          separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
          W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
          the CSS specification.
