            <h2>2008-20. THE BEST YEARS IN OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
              From the season 2008/09 under Josep Guardiola, the team improved
              even further. Playing with the same style that Cruyff had
              introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his team
              around the club's own youth system and promoted several young
              talents to the first team, and the result was the greatest Barça
              team ever. The greatest international recognition of this came
              when the FIFA Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010 shortlisted Xavi,
              Iniesta and Messi for the honour, all three of whom had grown up
              at La Masia, the residence where young sportspeople of all ages
              are trained and educated. This team was the culmination of
              everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing
              string of major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three
              Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World Cup, which was
              finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won
              all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the history of
              European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played
              memorable matches and won just about every title on offer. But the
              finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May, 2011,
              when the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams
              are made of. The world's press bestowed praise on this
              extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible
              chapters in the history of the game.

            <h2>BARÇA WIN THEIR THIRD CHAMPIONS LEAGUE</h2>
            <p>
              FC Barcelona went to the Olympic Stadium looking to claim their
              third title of the season after having won the Copa del Rey and
              the league. Guardiola went into the final against Manchester
              United with several players missing in defence. The Premier League
              side started strongly but Eto’o’s goal changed the game and from
              then on Barça dominated with Messi adding a second to make the
              final score 2-0. On 27 May 2009 Barça claimed their third
              Champions League title thanks to victory over the holders,
              becoming the first Spanish side to claim the treble of the Copa
              del Rey, the league and the Champions League. Under the direction
              of Josep Guardiola, the team had a dream 12 months, winning every
              trophy possible. Six titles that they claimed with authority,
              Barça on the field were untouchable. At the end of the season
              there were celebrations and the trophies kept coming for the rest
              of the year. FC Barcelona made history with the nomination of
              Xavi, Iniesta and Messi as finalists for the FIFA Ballon d'Or
              2010. Three Barça players who all came up through La Masia swept
              the podium. Journalists, coaches and captains from around the
              world, the elite of world football, lauded Barça’s style. It was
              the first time that all three finalists came from the youth
              academy of the same club. It was a full recognition of the work
              done at La Masia.
