          They just love hanging out with the people who make up their “family.”
          A Golden is typically very tolerant of children and tends to get along
          well with other family pets—cats included! Add an obedient and
          fiercely loyal nature along with patience and a fun-loving spirit, and
          you’ll see why Goldens make ideal family pets.

          Combine a statuesque build with a lustrous coat in all shades of gold,
          a well-groomed Golden is a sight to behold. But remember—that
          beautiful coat requires a good daily brushing and at least a
          once-monthly to look its best.
