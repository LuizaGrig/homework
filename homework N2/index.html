        The fjords, mountains and northern lights of Norway are known throughout
        the world. As is the “capitalism with a conscience” philosophy. But
        other than the obvious, how much do you really know about this
        Scandinavian country?

              At an astonishing 15 miles (24.5 km) long, the Lærdal Tunnel is
              the world’s longest. Costing 1 billion Norwegian kroner to build
              (that's about USD $110 million) the tunnel connects the small
              communities of Lærdal and Aurland.

              The somewhat counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a
              landmass does not have a well-defined length is known as the
              coastline paradox. Because of the fractal nature of a coastline,
              you can only define its length by using units of a specific
              length. When the unit length differs, the total length differs –
              and the difference

              The what now? We mean the Northern Lights, of course. This
              astounding light show happens when charged particles from the sun
              meet atoms in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, resulting in the
              release of photons (light particles). Regardless of the science
              behind it, the aurora borealis is beautiful, like green, red, and
              blue ribbons in the sky. Best seen further north.

              So, if you don’t speak Norwegian but you do speak Danish, then you
              can have a conversation. Likewise, if you’re in Sweden and you
              speak Swedish and happen to meet a Norwegian person, you’ll
              probably be able to understand each other. That’s Nordic languages
              for you.
